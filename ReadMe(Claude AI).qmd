# Project Brief

> As an analyst for ProWidget Systems, a UK-based B2B (business-to-business) retailer, you've been asked to report on spending volumes for London-based customers versus those based in the rest of the United Kingdom. The board has supplied a high-level data extract containing all customers' addresses and their total spending to date.
>
> **They want to know:**
>
> -   Which UK cities are currently underserved
> -   Whether their customers are primarily London based

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Analysis Scope & Approach

**This is a rapid first-pass analysis designed to give ballpark estimates, not precise figures.**

The goal is to quickly answer the board's questions with approximate directional insights. If these initial findings prove valuable, we can invest in more rigorous analysis with better data quality and more sophisticated metrics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Data Structure

This dataset contains 100K customer records showing their ID, address and total spend since ProWidget opened.

**Key Data Limitation:** Current extraction methods successfully parsed city names from only **43% of addresses**. All findings below are based on this subset and should be treated as approximate indicators rather than definitive figures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Working Definitions (For This First Pass)

## a. "Spending Volumes"

-   **Metric Used:** Total Spend
-   **Why:** Provides straightforward regional comparisons for quick assessment

## b. "Underserved" Cities

-   **Definition:** Cities with total spend below the average of all UK cities
-   **Why:** Simple baseline for identifying potentially underserved markets

## c. "Primarily London Based?"

-   **Metric Used:** City with highest Total Spend = primary customer base
-   **Why:** High spend typically correlates with more customers and transactions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Key Findings

## 1. Spending Volumes: London vs Rest of UK

![](images/DataVizOutputs/London%20Vs%20Other.png)

**Finding:** London brings in approximately the same total spend as all other major UK cities combined.

**Directional Insight:** London appears to be the dominant revenue center, though this could reflect either more customers or higher spend per customer (or both).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Customer Base Distribution

#### Top 10 Cities by Total Spend

![](images/DataVizOutputs/TopSpend.png)

**Finding:** London has the highest total spend compared to other UK cities.

**Directional Insight:** By total spend volume, our customer base appears to be primarily London-based. However, this doesn't necessarily mean London has the most customers - just the most revenue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Potentially Underserved Cities

#### Top 20 Cities by Total Spend

![](images/DataVizOutputs/LowSpend.png)

**Finding:** Only cities with large populations exceed the mean total spend across all cities ( LONDON,MANCHESTER,BIRMINGHAM,GLASGOW,BRISTOL,LEEDS,EDINBURGH,LEICESTER,NOTTINGHAM,LIVERPOOL,CARDIFF,SHEFFIELD )

**Directional Insight:** Most UK cities fall below average spend, suggesting potential underservice. However, this metric is heavily influenced by city size - smaller cities will naturally have lower absolute spend even if well-penetrated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Known Data Quality Issues

These issues affect precision but shouldn't invalidate the directional findings:

1.  **City extraction only successful for 43% of addresses** - findings are based on this subset
2.  **Zero-spend customers present in dataset** - unclear if these should be included in analysis
3.  **Duplicate addresses** - one address associated with 1000+ different companies (data quality concern)
4.  **Missing addresses** - some customers with purchases have no recorded address
5.  **Address format inconsistencies** - prevented full city extraction from all records

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What This Analysis IS Good For

✅ **Quick directional comparison** of London vs rest of UK spending volumes\
✅ **Ballpark identification** of cities with low current spend\
✅ **Initial hypothesis** that London is the dominant market\
✅ **Deciding whether deeper analysis has business value**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What This Analysis IS NOT Good For

❌ Precise market sizing or opportunity assessment\
❌ Marketing budget allocation decisions\
❌ Strategic expansion planning\
❌ Identifying true market penetration or saturation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Next Steps: IF There's Business Value

Before investing more time, we need to understand: **What decisions will this analysis drive?**

### If the board wants better precision, here's what we can do:

## Improve Data Quality (Effort: Medium)

1.  **Better city extraction:**
    -   Use postcodes + UK postcode database to map addresses to cities
    -   Consider Maps API (e.g., Google) for geocoding, though this raises privacy concerns with customer data
2.  **Validate duplicate addresses** - determine if data quality issue or legitimate (e.g., business parks)
3.  **Reconcile missing addresses** - check if other databases contain this information
4.  **Decision needed:** Include or exclude zero-spend customers?

## Improve Metrics (Effort: Medium-High)

1.  **Customer count by city**
    -   *What it gives us:* Better estimate of where our customer base is primarily located (independent of how much they spend)
    -   *Use case:* Distinguishes between "lots of small customers" vs "few big spenders" in each city
2.  **Spend per capita**
    -   *What it gives us:* True picture of which cities are underserved relative to their population size
    -   *Use case:* Identifies cities where we have low market penetration despite large potential customer pools
3.  **Market penetration rate**
    -   *What it gives us:* Our current customers as % of total addressable market in each city
    -   *Use case:* Shows which cities have room for growth vs which are already saturated
4.  **Customer acquisition trends over time**
    -   *What it gives us:* Which cities are growing vs declining in customer base
    -   *Use case:* Identifies emerging markets and helps predict future revenue distribution

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Key Question

**What business decision is this analysis supporting?**

-   **If it's:** "Should we focus sales efforts on London or regions?" → Current analysis is probably sufficient
-   **If it's:** "Where should we allocate our marketing budget?" → We need the deeper analysis
-   **If it's:** "Which city should we open a new office in?" → We need deeper analysis + other factors (talent, logistics, etc.)

**Let's align on the business value before investing in iteration.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Analysis Approach: Rapid first-pass with 43% data coverage. Treat all figures as approximate directional indicators. Recommend stakeholder discussion on business value before further refinement.*
