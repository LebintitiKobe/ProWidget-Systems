# Project Brief

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> As an analyst for ProWidget Systems, a UK-based B2B (business-to-business) retailer, you’ve been asked to report on spending volumes for London-based customers versus those based in the rest of the United Kingdom. The board has supplied a high-level data extract containing all customers’ addresses and their total spending to date.
>
> They want to know :
>
> -   Which UK cities are currently underserved
> -   Whether their customers are primarily London based

# Data Structure

This dataset contains 100K customer data showing their id , address and total spend since ProWidget opened

# Analysis Approach / Logical Framework

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assuming the results of analysis will be used just to get quick answers (not for any strategic

## a. "Spending volumes"

Used "Total Spend" metric

It provides straight forward regional comparisons .

## b. "Underserved" Cities

Cities with low total spend compared to others .

Any city that has total spend below the average total spend of all UK cities will be considered to be underserved . The average cities total spend provides a straight forward baseline we can use to figure out potentially underserved cities

## c. Whether their customers are primarily London based ?

City with the highest Total Spend will be considered city with primary customer base . High spend easily implies more customers , hence more transaction and more spend

# Insights Deep Dive

## 1. Spending Volumes Of London Compare To Other UK Cities

![](images/DataVizOutputs/London%20Vs%20Other.png)

London brings in almost the same sales revenue as all other UK major cities combined .

## 2. Customer Base

#### Top 10 Total Spend Cities

![](images/DataVizOutputs/TopSpend.png)

Since London has the highest total spend compared to other UK cities , then our customer base is primarily

## 3. Underserved Cities

#### Bottom 10 Total Spend Cities (Underserved)

![](images/DataVizOutputs/LowSpend.png)

Only cities with large populations have total spend greater than mean total spend , meaning the rest of the cities are potentially underserved .

# Data Issues 

#### Data has companies with Zero Total Spend 

#### Data has multiple companies with same address , one address had over 1000 different companies 

#### Data has companies that made purchases but addresses were not recorded 

#### Not all addresses were in format that allowed us to extract city names from the addresses , at least with the method we chose which only managed to extract cities from only 43% of our data 

# Further Possible Work 

#### We can use a better method to extract city names from our addresses :

1.  Current method used to extracting cities is looking up city names of government's list of all UK cities in our companies addresses
2.  We can use postcodes in order to figure which city the addresses belong . But this will require Postcode Data of all UK cities .
3.  We can send the addresses data to a MAPS API like google API to in return get city names that corresponds to each address . But this method raises privacy concerns , are we even allowed to send private customer data to an API ?

#### We can find other potential database where customers who made purchase but their addresses were not records in our data are stored

#### We can validate multiple companies with same addresses in our data 

#### Include / exclude companies with zero spend from our data to get a more accurate representation of our current customer base .  

### But before we can do extra work , we need to understand the business value of doing so . 

# Business Value 

## Uses Of Our Current Results : 

1.  To get ball-park city level total spend / customer volume comparison
2.  To get ball-park idea of which cities are potentially underserved

## For Market Spend Allocation

1.  We need a different and appropriate metric to understand cities with untapped customer acquisition opportunity like Total Spend per Capita , Number of customers from full consumer market .

### What is the business value of iterating the current analysis ?
